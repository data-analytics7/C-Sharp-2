# Geospatial-based Recommender System using Social Networks and Multimedia


The system is dependent on a person using lifelogging technology to input valuable personal information into the system, e.g. by uploading geotagged photos or status updates. 
The system can then use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to learn habits, cues, to support someone in their daily activities. 
The AI (in its simplest form, merely retrieving the “nearest” lifelogged information) will support the human memory and reasoning systems, for instance by knowing which photos, 
and other information, can be used at the appropriate moment to trigger memories. 

The GPS-enabled reminder system acts as a kind of “cognitive scaffold” supporting recall of important events, people, and so on in a persons’ environment. This integrated help 
can provide security to the user, by mitigating against anxiety, and even reduce care giver stress by lending support to daily activities and interactions.


• Task 01
Consider the events provided in the example SOAP file. Add in several more events (at least 20) into the file. You must include at least two tracklogs.

• Task 02
Create a Windows form GUI using Visual Studio. A key part of this must be a canvas area/map to display the events from your SOAP file.

• Task 03
Using LINQ to XML load the data from the SOAP file into an appropriate collection of objects. Use a C# Dictionary as the format for your collection. 
Develop an appropriate class(es) for the events.

• Task 04
Display the events (using suitable icons, text etc) on the canvas.

• Task 05
By clicking on the canvas, give the user the option to Add a new event, or Retrieve information. If Adding, use a subform to obtain the relevant information and 
insert into the SOAP file. If Retrieving, develop a method to indicate which of the current events are being accessed, and display the information 
(e.g. draw a line from the current position to the nearest Event, or a circumference around the current position etc.)
